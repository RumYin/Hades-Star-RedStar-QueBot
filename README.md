# Welcome to [Unnamed] Discord Bot

My alias is RumYin, and im a beginner coder. Im picking coding up as a pass-time and hope to get some usefull skills, or some fun tricks out of it. If anyone sees this and has usefull tips/tricks please let me know, as I am alwasy open to new ideas!


I wish to Create a Discord Bot that can be used as a 'group que' The primary funciton of the que will be to coordinate members of the server together for in- game-events. Simple commands will be used for user friendlyness. E.x. [prefix][in/out][(level) 1-10] or '!in 9/!in level 9'. The options provided here will either opt you 'in' or 'out' of the que. Roles will be pinged based on the level chosen. If level 1 que is started, all players in the Server with the Level 1 role, will be pinged/notified of the que start. They can 'opt in' to join the que, with a max of 4 players per que. The que should have a time limit of 15 minutes. After a 15 minutes pass the que will be auto cleared and set back to 0. 

As I am new to coding, this is more of a "any help is greatly apprecaited".
